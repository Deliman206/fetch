A pug that catches a frisbee
	
###Domain Model
1. As the user, we want to:

  *get as many points as possible within a certain time frame

2. As the developer, we want to:
  *let the user be the dog catching an object
  *let the thrower in the game throw at pre set levels
  *increase the distance the thrower throws at each level
    
3. STRETCH Goal
  *add obstactles for the dog to overcome

###Address details in the Problem Domain
TBD - We are debating fixed screen versus a map larger than the screen

###Sketches of the Wireframe

1. 1st page - 
  *get user Name
  *ask to select level
  *hide form, show game
  *after game is over...
2. 2nd page - 
  *show high score
  *link to play again
3. 3rd page -

###Conflict Resolution
*reduce stress by separating features into different branches and assigning them to different members

###Proof of life
*implement key binding
*Make objects move on canvas

###Goals
*hammer out easy hurdles first

###Git Process
*constantly communicate individual git hub process
*keep branches separated
*each person will work on a seperate feature to avoid conflict
*submit a branch a day per person for up to 20 total throughout
*commit often
